A website to demonstrate my web development skills.

# Milestone1
## Specifications
Great job on Milestone1, you met all the specifications laid out in the documentation. Your HTML is standards compliant.  The directory structure matches what was outlined. Finally, the content is straightforward and I am able to  identify what you want to accomplish and who is your target audience.
## Feedback
There are a few things I need you to fix before moving ahead to Milestone2a.
Both /styles.css and /elizabeth sanders.jpg need to be moved inside the documentation directory. The documentation should be self contained in its directory so unintended side effects are not possible when your developing the site. You also have a space in /elizabeth sanders.jpg, spaces are NOT allowed in file names per the style guide. the file name should be elizabeth-sanders.jpg. Once you have fixed the what I laid out feel free to move ahead to Milestone2a
