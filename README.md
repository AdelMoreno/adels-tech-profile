A website to demonstrate my web development skills.

# Milestone1
## Specifications
Great job on Milestone1, you met all the specifications laid out in the documentation. Your HTML is standards compliant.  The directory structure matches what was outlined. Finally, the content is straightforward and I am able to  identify what you want to accomplish and who is your target audience.
## Feedback
There are a few things I need you to fix before moving ahead to Milestone2a.
Both /styles.css and /elizabeth sanders.jpg need to be moved inside the documentation directory. The documentation should be self contained in its directory so unintended side effects are not possible when your developing the site. You also have a space in /elizabeth sanders.jpg, spaces are NOT allowed in file names per the style guide. the file name should be elizabeth-sanders.jpg. Once you have fixed the what I laid out feel free to move ahead to Milestone2a

# Milestone 2a
## Overall Feedback
Good job on Milestone2a. Directory structure, Html, git history, and content meet the requirements laid out in the documentation.
### Wireframes
Your wireframes are clean and easy to understand. The only issue with the wireframes are that your portfolio section does not match the content strategy. I wanted to see more detail for your image gallery. What you have is unambiguous and could be anything related with cards. Your Contact section may give you a little bit of a headache. With how Bootstrap works it might be difficult to have your links switch positions with your contact form in the desktop view.
### Content Strategy
Im a little confused about how you want to incorporate photo bucket. Is that where you want to store your images? I am not aware of any third party UI plugins maintained by Photobucket. I also would have liked to see more detail about styling in your content strategy.
## Design Tips
I reccomend you spend a little more time to layout what your image gallery will look like. It is extremely important to have a clear vision what you hope to accomplish when begining development.

## Moving Foreword
We'll be building PWP in a file named index.php inside of /public_html. Please note that no site files should live outside of the /public_html directory. Please use an organized and standards-compliant directory structure to house all images, JavaScript, CSS, etc. We are done with the /documentation directory from here out!
